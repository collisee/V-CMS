Unfortunately, you CANNOT use this trick to get weapon types that can't be
thrown, like rods and staves.  Weapons exclusive to the multiplayer mode also
can't be obtained this way since they also can't be thrown.


---TACTICS FOR OBTAINING WEAPONS---
There's no way to control what abilities an enemy Ninja has learned, so you
can't change what TYPES of weapons they will throw.  However, you CAN
change the enemy's levels.

So, the best strategy if you want to acquire a particular weapon is to look
for a Ninja that can throws the right weapon type.  Then, adjust his/her level
until it matches what you want in the table above.  For example, if you want an
Excalibur, find a Ninja that sometimes throws Knight's Swords.  Then level up or
level down that Ninja until it is at level 96.

To LEVEL UP the enemy ninjas, let them land successful attacks on you.  Chantage
(or any Reraise/healing ability, really) can be helpful in surviving repeated
attacks.

To LEVEL DOWN the enemy ninjas, bring a Mindflayer monster and have it stand
next to someone with the Beastmaster ability.  This will allow the Mindflayer
to use its Level Drain ability, which reduces an enemy's level by 1.  (You'll
only need the Mindflayer if the item you want is not thrown at level 99.)

The Nagnarok may be particularly tricky to get since it has low attack power and
even level 95 Ninjas may not throw it very often.  One possible solution is to 
first inflict the Confuse status on a level 95 Ninja (e.g. by using the Mystic's
Delirium or Beowulf's Confuse).

Reader Piers* reports that Ninjas are more apt to throw powerful weapons when
your HP is high.  When you're low on HP, the Ninjas will just try to finish you
off with a throwing star/bomb or the Nagnarok.  So, keep your HP if you want to
earn powerful weapons!

%%%MISSABLE ITEMS AND EVENTS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%00miss

This is a quick list of story events and unique items that you can "miss" over 
the course of the game, and what you need to do to make sure you're able to
see every story events and collect every item in the single-player mode.  This 
is just a quick list of key points; for a more detailed treatment, see the 
corresponding walkthrough section.

Points marked ESSENTIAL *must* be completed to get an item or see an event.
Points marked GOOD IDEA are not strictly necessary, but will make the process
easier -- for example, stealing a rare item that otherwise can only be obtained
through poaching a hard-to-find enemy.  Finally, I've pointed out some points
that seem like they might be needed but are actually NOT IMPORTANT, so that you
don't have to worry about them!

---CHAPTER I--------------------------------------------------------------------

* ESSENTIAL: At the start of the battle at Mandalia Plains, you'll be given a 
choice whether to help Argath or directly attack the enemy.  Choosing the first 
option lets you see a few extra lines of dialogue during the last battle of
the chapter, but it does NOT affect your ability to see anything later on.

---CHAPTER II-------------------------------------------------------------------

* ESSENTIAL: At the very beginning of this chapter, you will be able to add 
Alicia and Lavian to your roster.  Add them to your roster, and do NOT let them 
leave until you have completed the Agrias's Birthday sidequest in Chapter IV.
This means that you must not dismiss them, must not let them get turned into 
crystals/chests, and must not let them abandon the party due to having a very 
low Bravery or very high Faith.  It's OK if they're temporarily KOed.

* NOT IMPORTANT: At this time, you will also be able to add Ladd to your 
roster.  Ladd is basically just a generic male human.  He doesn't have any 
special abilities and isn't needed for any sidequests.  So, you can take him or 
leave him as you want.

* GOOD IDEA: At the start of the story battle at Araguay Woods, you'll be given 
a choice whether to help Boco.  Choose the second option to avoid losing
Bravery.  However, your choice here does not affect anything else.

* NOT IMPORTANT: After the Araguay Woods battle, you will be able to add Boco 
the chocobo to your roster.  Like Ladd, Boco isn't really special; he's just a
regular yellow Chocobo.  (He does have a unique message when you press Select
and choose his name, but that's all.)  So, you don't have to take him along.

* NOT TOO IMPORTANT: At the story battle at Tchigolith Fenlands, there's a 
chance of encountering an enemy Pig.  Recruit it (using Entice or Time) if you
see it, as you can breed it and poach the pigs for rare items.  If you don't see
it, though, it's by no means essential to get here as you'll have many other
chances to recruit them later.

* ESSENTIAL: After completing the story battle at the Clockwork City of Goug, 
you will be able to add Mustadio to your roster.  Mustadio is a unique story 
character and is also needed for most of the sidequests in Chapter IV, so add 
him to your roster and don't lose him.  (As with the other essential characters,
it's fine if he's temporarily KOed as long as he doesn't die permanently.)

* ESSENTIAL: After the battle at Balias Swale, you will be able to add Agrias 
to your roster.  Agrias is another unique story character and is needed for two
sidequests in Chapter IV, so add her to your team.

* ESSENTIAL: Deploying Agrias during the battle at Golgollada Gallows will 
allow you to see some extra dialogue between her and Ramza.  This dialogue is 
not, however, needed to unlock anything else later.

---CHAPTER III------------------------------------------------------------------

* GOOD IDEA: When Alma joins the party, it's a good idea de-equip her Healing 
Staff and Barette (as well as her Red Shoes) before you go to the Orbonne 
Monastery.  This is not *required* as both these items can be poached later: 
the Healing Staff is a rare poach from Dryads and the Barette is a rare poach 
from Red Chocobos.

* NOT IMPORTANT: During a story event, you will be asked whether or not you 
have read the Scriptures of Germonique.  Your response here has no bearing on 
anything, so don't worry about it :)

* GOOD IDEA: The story battle at Zeklaus Desert features all three types of
behemoths.  All three types of behemoth yield rare items when poached.  So, you
may want to poach them, or recruit one or more onto your team (with Entice or 
Tame) to breed more behemoths for poaching.  However, it is not necessary to
poach/recruit them here as there are plenty of behemoths in random battles 
later in the game.

* ESSENTIAL: After the battle at Zeklaus Desert, you will be able to add Luso 
to your roster.  This is your only opportunity to get this unique character on 
your team, so add him.  (Luso is not needed to unlock any other events, 
though.)

* ESSENTIAL: At the very end of Chapter III, you will be given a chance to add
Rapha and Marach to your roster.  Both are unique story characters and each has
different abilities, so sign them up.  (They are not, however, very useful :P.)

---CHAPTER IV-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Gollund Colliery sidequest is available at the beginning of this chapter.
Assuming you still have Mustadio, Agrias, Alicia, and Lavian on your roster, 
the Agrias's Birthday sidequest is also available at this time.  Both of these 
sidequests are available until completed and never disappear.  (See Walkthrough 
- Sidequests for the full walkthroughs for these quests.)

* GOOD IDEA: As a general note, the maximum roster size of 24 is just big enough
to keep the 18 story characters (including Boco and Ladd) plus the 6 generic
characters you start Chapter I with.  So, if you want to keep all those
characters, finish breeding monsters to poach BEFORE you fill up the last two
slots on your roster.  On the other hand, Boco, Ladd, and the initial 6 generics
have no special characteristics and you don't miss anything if you delete them.

---Agrias's Birthday---
* ESSENTIAL: After completing the Agrias's Birthday sidequest, you will receive
the Tynar Rouge accessory.  This is a one-of-a-kind item and cannot be 
replaced, so don't throw it away, or let it get broken or stolen by an enemy.

After completing the Agrias's Birthday event, Alicia and Lavian are not 
strictly needed for any other events, although they will appear in Disorder in 
the Order if you still have them along.

---Gollund Colliery---
* ESSENTIAL: Near the beginning of this quest (at the Tavern in Lesalia), 
Beowulf will ask you to team up.  Choose the second option to agree to this.
Otherwise, Beowulf will leave and the quest cannot be completed.

* GOOD IDEA: In the third battle in this quest (Gollund Colliery Ridge), you
will encounter an enemy Pig.  Entice or Tame the Pig so you can start breeding 
monsters from the pig family.  Some rare items can only be obtained by poaching
pig-family monsters -- including those from the Wild Boar monster, which can 
ONLY be obtained by breeding!  If you do miss the Pig here, though, you can get 
others later.

* ESSENTIAL: After completing the last battle of this quest, Beowulf and Holy
Dragon Reis will offer to join your team.  Both are unique story characters and
both are needed for later quests, so sign them up.

* ESSENTIAL: Upon return to the Clockwork City of Goug, Construct 8 will also 
be offered as another character.  Construct 8 is another unique character, so
recruit it.

---Chapter IV Main Quest - Up to Bervenia Free City---
* GOOD IDEA: During the story battle at Bervenia Free City, you may want to
steal the Defender and Chantage from Meliadoul, especially since both are good
items.  However, these can also be poached/stolen/caught later if you miss them.

After completing the story battle at the Free City of Bervenia, the Recruiting 
Balthier sidequest is now available.  It does not depend on any missable 
factors.

---Recruiting Balthier Quest---
* ESSENTIAL: After you complete this quest, Balthier will offer to join.  
Again, he is a unique story character, so sign him up.  He is not needed for 
any other quests.

* ESSENTIAL: Balthier's initial equipment includes the Ras Algethi gun and the 
Mirage Vest body armor.  Both of these are unique items in single-player, so, 
again, don't throw them away or let them get broken.  (Note that you must sign 
up Balthier to get them.)  It is possible to get additional guns and vests in
the multiplayer modes.

---Chapter IV Main Quest - Finnath Creek to Sal Ghidos---
* GOOD IDEA: During the story battle at Finnath Creek (NOT during the random
battles), there's a random chance of encountering one more enemy Pigs.  If you 
don't already have one, Entice or Tame a Pig so you can start breeding 
monsters from the pig family.  Some rare items can only be obtained by poaching 
pig-family monsters -- including those from the Wild Boar monster, which can 
ONLY  be obtained by breeding!  If you don't get any Pigs here, you can get 
others later.

* GOOD IDEA: In the story battle at Beddha Sandwaste, you can steal a Glacial
Gun from Barich.  This is a rare item that can't be bought in stores, but it's
not unique and you can get an infinite supply from random battles later.

* NOT IMPORTANT: At Fort Besselat, you'll have a choice of attacking either the
south wall or north wall.  These are different battles, but neither has any
special items and you'll end up in the same place eventually, so it doesn't
matter which you choose.

* ESSENTIAL: After completing the battles at Fort Besselat, Orlandeau will 
offer to join.  Sign him up as he is another unique story character.

* GOOD IDEA: Orlandeau's initial equipment includes the Excalibur knight's
sword.  The Excalibur isn't unique (an infinite supply can be caught from high-
level enemy Ninjas), but Excaliburs are hard to get, so hang on to it!

* ESSENTIAL: When you first visit the Trade City of Sal Ghidos, you will see a
cutscene in which Aerith offers you a flower.  Choose the SECOND option to buy
the flower.  If you do not buy the flower, you will NOT be able to complete the
Nelveska Temple & Recruiting Cloud subquests, and there is only ONE chance to
get it!!

Once you have the flower, you can complete the Nelveska Temple sidequest if you 
also finished the Gollund Colliery quest and still have Beowulf and Reis on 
your team.

---Nelveska Temple Quest---
* ESSENTIAL: Using the Treasure Hunter ability, move atop the left pillar to
find the Escutcheon (II) shield.  You will need to use a large monster (such as
Reis or Construct 8) as a stepping-stone to get up on top of the pillar.  You 
may instead receive a crummy regular Escutcheon; the chance of getting this BAD 
Escutcheon is equal to your Bravery.  So, a lower Bravery is better!  This is
the ONLY chance to get the Escutcheon II in the game and you CANNOT come back 
to this map afterwards, so you must pick it up here to get every item.

* GOOD IDEA: The Javelin II, Sasuke's Blade, and Nagnarok weapons can also be
found with Treasure Hunter and low Bravery here.  These, however, are not
unique; Sasuke's Blade and the Javelin II can be caught from enemy Ninjas and
the Nagnarok can be poached from Swine.

* ESSENTIAL: After completing the events in this quest, Reis's new version will
offer to rejoin your party.  She is another unique story character and needed
for the Lionel's New Liege Lord quest, so sign her up.

---Chapter IV Main Quest - Mount Germinas to Limberry---
* ESSENTIAL: The Mount Germinas map contains an item, the Invisibility Cloak,
that's one-of-a-kind in single-player.  It's found using Treasure Hunter atop 
the mountain; see Battle 42 Tactics and Secrets for a map to its location.)  
Again, the lower your Bravery, the better chance of getting the Invisibility 
Cloak instead of just an Ether.  You only get to pick up ONE of these items, so 
if you end up with the Ether, the Invisibility Cloak is gone for good!  Unlike 
with the Nelveska Temple items, however, there's absolutely no need to get this 
during the story battle here -- you can come back and get it in a random battle 
at any time.  It's also possible to win Invisibility Cloaks in Rendezvous Mode.

* GOOD IDEA: You may encounter another Pig in the story battle at Finnath 
Creek.  (It's random whether or not you'll see it.)  If you missed the Pig in 
the Gollund Colliery, try to recruit this one.  If you don't get one here, you 
can still find an infinite supply in Dorvauldar Marsh or the last floor of 
Midlight's Deep.

* GOOD IDEA: At Limberry, you'll face a series of four battles.  In the first
three battles, you'll want to learn Ultima by having one of the Assassins or
Ultima Demons cast it on either Ramza in his Squire job, or Luso in his Game 
Hunter job.  It is easiest by far to learn it in the first battle (at the
gate).

* NOT IMPORTANT: You can't steal Elmdore's equipment in this version of the
game, so don't even try.

* ESSENTIAL: After winning all the battles at Limberry, Meliadoul will offer to
join you.  Sign her up; she is a unique character and is needed for another 
couple story events.

* GOOD IDEA: Meliadoul comes with a Save The Queen sword.  Again, the supply of
these is actually unlimited (since they can be caught from enemy Ninjas), but 
keeping this one as a good idea!

The Recruiting Cloud quest is now available.

---Recruiting Cloud Quest---
* ESSENTIAL: When given the chance to sign up Cloud, add him.  He isn't needed
for anything else, but IS a unique story character.

* GOOD IDEA: Cloud's Materia Blade is found atop Mount Bervenia using Treasure
Hunter.  Bravery is NOT important.  Try to hang onto it since Cloud needs it 
for his Limit command, but if you lose it, you CAN get more from enemy Ninjas.

---Chapter IV Main Quest - Eagrose to End---
* ESSENTIAL: After Limberry, you will be directed back to Eagrose.  On your way
back to Eagrose, enter Dorter Trade City for an optional battle.  (This battle
will only trigger if you have Meliadoul on your roster.)  If you visit Eagrose
before activated this battle, it will disappear.

* GOOD IDEA: In the aforementioned Dorter battle, you can steal a Dragon Rod
from Cletienne.  This weapon can also be found as a rare poach from Blue
Dragons, but it's easiest to steal.

* GOOD IDEA: The boss at Eagrose has a Defender sword you can steal, if you
missed the one at Bervenia or want a second one.  Again, there's actually an
unlimited supply of Defenders (from poaching Elder Treants), so you don't 
*have* to get this one.

* GOOD IDEA: Once you get to Mullonde, you'll face a series of three battles.
In the first battle, the enemy Summoner has another Dragon Rod if you missed 
the prior one.

* ESSENTIAL: For the second battle at Mullonde, deploy Meliadoul for some
additional mid-battle dialogue.  (This is not needed to unlock anything else,
however.)

* ESSENTIAL: If you have not yet learned the Ultima spell, the third battle at
Mullonde is your last chance in the single-player mode to learn and keep it.
You'll get the magick if Ultima Demons cast it on either Ramza in his Squire 
job, or Luso in his Game Hunter job.

Once you complete the battles at Mullonde, you will be able to complete the 
last set of sidequests, as well as the last set of story battles.  You must 
still have Beowulf, Reis, and Agrias to complete this final set of sidequests.

* ESSENTIAL: After entering Orbonne Monastery for the final sequence of 
battles, SAVE YOUR GAME IN A DIFFERENT SLOT.  You will NOT be able to get out 
to the world map again.  So, if you want to be able to roam the map at all, you 
must keep a separate save from BEFORE you went into the Monastery.

---Lionel's New Liege Lord Quest---
* NOT IMPORANT: Aliste has Safeguard, so you can't steal any of his Genji gear.
Sorry.

* ESSENTIAL: After completing the first battle of this quest, you will receive
the Genji Armor as a battle trophy.  This is a unique item, so do not let get 
it stolen or broken.

* GOOD IDEA: You can steal the Masamune from one of the enemy samurai in the
second battle of this quest.  The Masamune can only be otherwise obtained by
catching it from enemy Ninjas (or winning it in Rendezvous Mode), so it's good 
to get here.  (Be careful using the Masamune for Iaido; if it breaks, you'll 
need Sticky Fingers to get a replacement!)

* GOOD IDEA: You can also steal a Cachusha and Barette from the enemy Mystics 
in the same battle.  These are also available from poaching.

* ESSENTIAL: You will receive a Zeus Mace as a battle trophy after the second
battle.  Keep it; this is one of only two in the game.

---Disorder in the Order Quest---
* GOOD IDEA: If you still have Alicia and Lavian in your roster, the story 
event at Zeltennia Castle will include them in the background.  However, having 
them here doesn't affect the actual event, nor your ability to do anything else
later.  Note that once you've completed this event, Alicia and Lavian aren't
used for anything else, so you could dismiss them if you want since they're 
otherwise just generic characters.

* ESSENTIAL: If you bring Orlandeau to the battle in this quest, you can see a
little extra dialogue.  But, it's not needed for anything else.

* ESSENTIAL: In the battle in this quest, you can steal Venetian and Kaiser
Shields from the two Knights, and Ninja Gear from the enemy Monk.  There is 
only other one copy of each of these items in the single-player mode, so be 
sure to snag them.  (However, you can get an infinite supply in multiplayer.)

* GOOD IDEA: You can also steal a Sasuke's Blade, Barette, Blaze Gun, and
Glacial Gun in the same battle, although none of these are strictly necessary.

---Midlight's Deep---
All the floors of Midlight's Deep have items you can find with Treasure Hunter.
Again, a lower Bravery increases your chance is needed to get these items;
otherwise, you just get a Phoenix Down.  If you get the Phoenix Down, the 
"good" item disappears, even if you leave the battle and re-enter.

* GOOD IDEA: Good Treasure Hunter pickups on The Crevasse: Glacial Gun and 
Blaze Gun.  (Both also obtainable in random battles, however.)

* GOOD IDEA: Good Treasure Hunter pickups on The Stair: Save The Queen and 
Blood Sword.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Hollow: Zeus Mace.  There are only
two of these available in the game; the other comes from the Lionel's New Liege
Lord quest.
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Hollow: Yoichi Bow.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Catacombs: Rod of Faith.  Only
available here.
* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Catacombs: Kaiser Shield.  One of
only two in single-player; the other comes from Disorder in the Order.
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Catacombs: Faerie Harp.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Oubliette: Iga Blade (the only one
in the single-player game)
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Oubliette: Excalibur.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Palings: Cursed Ring.  This is the
only one in the game, and also pretty much essential for completing one of the
Rendezvous Mode missions.
* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Palings: Ninja Gear (1 of 2 in the
single-player game; the other from Disorder in the Order).
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Palings: Blaster gun.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Crossing: Staff of the Magi (only 
one in the game).
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Crossing: Koga Blade.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickups on The Switchback: Perseus Bow and Lordly
Robe (both only available here in single-player, but can be found in 
Rendezvous).
* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickup on The Switchback: Excalibur.

* ESSENTIAL: Treasure Hunter pickups on The Interstice: Maximillian and Grand 
Helm (both unique), and Venetian Shield (1 of 2 in the single-player game; the 
other is from Disorder in the Order)

* ESSENTIAL: The first time you enter floor 10 (Terminus), you'll fight a story
battle.  This is your only chance to obtain the Zodiark summon in the single-
player game, by having it the boss cast it on a character using the Summoner 
job.  Use Mana Shield to survive the spell.

* ESSENTIAL: After defeating Elidibus, you will be able to sign up the Byblos.
This is a unique monster/character, so add it.

* GOOD IDEA: Treasure Hunter pickups on Terminus: Chaos Blade and Chirijiraden.
(Be careful using the Chirijiraden for Iaido; if it breaks, you'll have to 
catch a replacement!)

XII. ERRANDS
********************************************************************************

%%%GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT ERRANDS%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%00err0

---Beginning and Ending an Errand-----------------------------------------------

--THE BASICS--
Errands are used to earn extra JP and gil.  When you accept an errand at a
Tavern, you'll pay a small fee and can send 1-3 characters away on the errand.
The characters will be gone for the number of days you chose; during this time,
they can't fight or change jobs/equipment.  When the number of days of the
errand has elapsed, return to the Tavern and choose Report.  (It has to be at
the same town as where the Errand started.)  When you click Report, you'll hear 
whether or not the Errand was successful.

If the errand is successful, you'll earn some gil and the 1-3 characters sent 
on the errand will gain some JP for their current job.  Some errands pay quite 
well and can net you more than 20,000 gil, while others pay less than it costs
to sign up for them!  

Your earnings are largely based on:
 > The particular errand
 > Sending more characters nets you more gil)
 > Deploying the characters for more days

Your current job, experience level, and sometimes your Bravery/Faith values also
play a small role in determining your pay; more details are below.

Only generic human characters, not monsters or special story characters, may be
sent on errands.  Ladd, Alicia, and Lavian are considered generic characters
for this purpose.


--ARTEFACTS AND WONDERS--
Some errands reward you with Artefacts or Wonders of the Ancient World.  These
prizes are displayed in your Chronicle menu, but otherwise have no impact on
the game.

See the Artefacts and Wonders section for a complete list of these.


--WHEN DO NEW ERRANDS APPEAR?--
Errands are not available until Chapter II.  Beginning in Chapter II, new 
errands regularly appear in the Taverns as you progress through the game.  Each 
town has its own set of errands.

If you don't complete an errand during the Chapter in which it first appears,
it will still be there in future chapters and you can always come back to it!

Some errands are not available until you complete other errands first.

There are also a few errands that are only available during specific months; 
these appear at the bottom of the Errands list below.


--ERRAND STATUS--
Forget what Errands your characters are going?  Open the menu on the map screen
and go to Chronicle -> Feats -> Present.  That shows all the errands you're
currently working on, who's working on them, what town they're in, and how many
days remain.


--ABANDONING AN ERRAND--
If you need to quickly get back your deployed characters, you can go to a 
Tavern in any town (it does not have to be the one from which they embarked) 
and choose Recall Units.

After you choose Recall Units, the characters will give up on the errand and 
head back home.  After another day has passed (i.e., one move on the world map),
go to the Tavern from which you deployed the characters (this time, it MUST be 
the same town) and choose Report to get them back.  The errand will have ended 
in failure, but the characters will be returned to your active roster, and you
can retry the errand next month.

Of course, since it takes 1-2 days to get your characters back even after doing
a Recall, there's no sense in abandoning an errand that only has 1-2 days left
to finish!


--MONTH-SPECIFIC ERRANDS--
Four errands (the Contest errands) can only be begun during particular months
of the Ivalician calendar, in addition to the other requirements.

However, if you miss one of these errands during its month, you can wait until
the calendar cycles around to the next year and you reach that month again.

These errands are worth doing if you can catch them, since they yield high
amounts of JP and gil!

---Errand Success and Failure---------------------------------------------------

The characters you deploy on an Errand (up to 3) work together to complete the
errand.

Each character contributes a number of "Work Points" based on three factors:
 * Current job
 * Bravery & Faith
 * Exp Level
(In the section below, I describe exactly how each of these 3 factors
contributes Work Points.)

Success is NOT affected by the number of days you deploy the characters, nor is
it affected by a character's equipment, gender, Zodiac sign, current abilities,
or stats aside from Bravery and Faith.


(Note that you never actually *see* the Work Points number; the game calculates
it invisibly.)

---OUTCOME---
The Work Points from ALL the deployed characters are then summed up to determine
whether or not you complete the errand.

WORK POINTS    RESULT          CHANGE IN JP       CHANGE IN GIL     BONUS GIVEN?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0 - 59 total  EPIC FAILURE    Reduced to 1/20    Reduced to 1/20   No
59 - 98 total  FAILURE         Reduced to 1/10    Reduced to 1/5    No
99+ total      SUCCESS         Normal             Normal            Yes

---CONSEQUENCES OF FAILURE---
As you can see in the above chart, FAILUREs and EPIC FAILUREs greatly reduce the
JP and gil you earn from a job.  They also prevent you from earning of the
special bonuses described below.

However, if you fail an errand, let the calendar advance to the next month and
the errand should re-appear in the Tavern, and you get another chance.

Note that failures really only tend to occur if ALL of the characters you send
are totally ill-suited for the errand.  As long as you have at least one decent 
character on the errand, you should succeed.

Although characters can sometimes fail an errand, no harm ever comes to the
characters.  You cannot lose characters or items on an errand.

---SKILL SAVER JOBS---
There's another way to achieve a SUCCESS on certain errands.

Some errands have a particular job (e.g. Chemist) designated as the "Skill
Saver" job.  Deploying 1 or more characters in that job will give you a random
chance to turn a FAILURE/EPIC FAILURE into a SUCCESS regardless of the Work
Points you earned.  (This is where the "The skills of the Archer were a great
boon to us!"-type messages appear.)

1 character has Skill Saver job  : 61.00% chance to turn failure into SUCCESS
2 characters has Skill Saver job : 76.21% chance to turn failure into SUCCESS
3 characters has Skill Saver job : 97.02% chance to turn failure into SUCCESS

EXAMPLE: The Skill Saver job for "Lake Poescas Depths" is Samurai.  If you
deploy 2 Samurai on the errand, you'll have a 76% chance of achieving a SUCCESS
on the errand even if you scored fewer than 99 Work Points.

Of course, if you score 99 or more Work Points on an errand, you always have a
100% chance of SUCCESS.  The Skill Saver jobs only come into play if you would
otherwise get a FAILURE or EPIC FAILURE.

Skill Saver jobs do not directly increase the JP/gil you earn.  Moreover, in
many cases, they aren't the jobs that will actually maximize your JP/gil intake!
So, you probably don't need to use them as it's pretty easy to get a SUCCESS on
most errands anyway.

But, just in case, the Skill Saver job for each errand is displayed in the
Errand List below.  (Not all errands have one.)

---Work Points------------------------------------------------------------------

As noted above, the Work Points scored by each character determine whether or
not you succeed at the Errand, and how much gil/JP you earn as a result.
END END ENDEND END ENDEND END ENDEND END ENDEND END ENDEND END ENDEND END END
